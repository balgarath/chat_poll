ChatPoll
========

This is a simple chat plugin for Rails, designed to be a drop-in solution.  It uses the JQuery library,
along with the timer and form plugins.  It operates by polling the server(these timing can be changed 
in chat.js), so this is in no way a scalable solution.
For now, the only way to specify a username is by adding a ?user=name to the end of the URL.  I plan to be 
updating this part very soon, to make it easy to hook into existing authentication schemes.


Usage
=====
#install engines
./script/plugin install git://github.com/lazyatom/engines.git

#install chat_poll
./script/plugin install git://github.com/balgarath/chat_poll.git

script/generate plugin_migration && rake db:migrate
