ChatPoll
========

This is a simple chat plugin for Rails, designed to be a drop-in solution.  It uses the JQuery library,
along with the timer and form plugins.  It operates by polling the server(these timing can be changed 
in chat.js), so this is in no way a scalable solution.
For now, the only way to specify a username is by adding a ?user=name to the end of the URL.  I plan to be 
updating this part very soon, to make it easy to hook into existing authentication schemes.


Usage
=====
Note: Rails 2.3.2 is required for this version.  If you need to use an 
earlier version of Rails, you need to install the version of Engines to 
match it, and you may need to change a few things(like the routes.rb 
file in the plugin) to make it work.  Rails has added lots of support 
for Engines in 2.3.2, so some things have changed.

#install engines
./script/plugin install git://github.com/lazyatom/engines.git

#add the following line to your apps config/environment.rb, after require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'boot')
require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../vendor/plugins/engines/boot')

#install chat_poll
./script/plugin install git://github.com/balgarath/chat_poll.git

script/generate plugin_migration && rake db:migrate
